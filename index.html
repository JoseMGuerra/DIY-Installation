                    <h2>What is arficial grass?</h2>
                    <p>Artificial grass is a surface of synthetic fibers made to look like natural grass. It is most
                        often
                        used in arenas for sports that were originally or are normally played on grass. However, it is
                        now
                        being used on residential lawns and commercial applications as well.</p>

                 <!-- installation step 1 -->

                <h3><i class="fas fa-digging"></i> Step 1</h3>
                <h4>Digging the area</h4>
                <p>First step is to prepare the area by removing the topsoil to a depth of 100mm. This can be
                    done by hand if it is a small area, but it will be easier if using a turf cutter.
                </p>

                </div>

                  <!-- installation step 2 -->

                <h3><i class="fas fa-crop"></i> Step 2</h3>
                <h4>Edging the area</h4>
                <p>Using batons and 100mm treated timber I make a frame around the area.This step is important
                    as
                    will give support to our newly installed grass and a clean edge finish. Ensuring edging is
                    not
                    higher than final grass line to allow the water
                    to run-off the turf.</p>
