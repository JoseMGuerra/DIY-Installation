                    <h2>What is arficial grass?</h2>
                    <p>Artificial grass is a surface of synthetic fibers made to look like natural grass. It is most
                        often
                        used in arenas for sports that were originally or are normally played on grass. However, it is
                        now
                        being used on residential lawns and commercial applications as well.

                <!-- Installation step 1 -->

                <h3><i class="fas fa-digging"></i> Step 1</h3>
                <h4>Digging the area</h4>
                <p>First step is to prepare the area by removing the topsoil to a depth of 100mm. This can be
                    done by hand if it is a small area, but it will be easier if using a turf cutter.
                </p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="assets/images/digging.png" alt="removing the turf" width="382" height="200">
                </div>

                <!-- Installation step 2 -->

                <h3><i class="fas fa-crop"></i> Step 2</h3>
                <h4>Edging the area</h4>
                <p>Using batons and 100mm treated timber, make a frame around the area.This step is important
                    as will give support to our newly installed grass and a clean edge finish. Please, make sure the
                    edging is not higher than final grass line to allow the water
                    to run-off the turf.
                </p>

                        width="382" height="200">
                </div>

                <!-- Installation step 3 -->

                <h3><i class="fas fa-digging"></i> Step 3</h3>
                <h4>Subbase</h4>
                <p> Then cover two thirds of the depth (approx. 70mm) with a crush stones aggregate like MOT
                    type-1. This can be purchased from local DIY store or reliable builders providers. You will
                    level and compact using a compactor plate at this point. This will provide a solid base and good
                    drainage.
                </p>

                <div class="image"><img src="assets/images/subbase-layer.png" alt="Fill the area with subbase type-1"
                        width="382" height="200">
                </div>

                <!-- Installation step 4 -->

                <h3><i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i> Step 4</h3>
                <h4>Weed barrier</h4>
                <p>You will then fit a weed barrier on the entire base of the soil base,
                    overlapping the barrier to prevent weeds growing through.
                </p>

                        height="200">
                </div>

                <!-- Installation step 5 -->

                <h3><i class="fas fa-digging"></i> Step 5</h3>
                <h4>Granite dust</h4>
                <p>Next add up 25mm of granite dust, then you will compact couple of times with a compactor plate.
                    The more times you compact the granite dust the less chance
                    there will be of sinkage. The base needs to be completely level with the timbers because the
                    artificial grass will mirror what is beneath it, ,if you have lumpy groundworks your
                    artificial lawn will be the same.
                </p>

                <div class="image">
                    <img src="assets/images/bedding-layer.png" alt="Granite dust area" width="382" height="200">
                </div>

                <!-- Installation step 6 -->

                <h3><i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i> Step 6</h3>
                <h4>Lay out the grass</h4>
                <p>Unroll your artificial grass into position, with the pile direction facing towards the
                    property or main focus point,for a more natural look.
                    Leave it unroll for 2 to 3 hours to acclimatate.
                </p>

                <div class="image">
                    <img src="assets/images/install-grass.png" alt="laid out sheet of grass" width="382" height="200">
                </div>

                <!-- Installation step 7 -->

                <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-puzzle-piece"></i> Step 7</h3>
                <h4>Joining the grass</h4>
                <p>Now I join the sheets of grass if necessary, leaving an extra 50mm around all areas. It is
                    very important to cut 3 rows of stiches on the rubber side of each grass sheet to achieve an
                    invisible join.
                    I then fold over each side of grass and roll out the joining tape, shiny side down.
                    Apply aquabond glue on a zig-zag pattern over the joining tape, and glue the two pieces of
                    grass together.
                </p>

                </div>

                <!-- Installation step 8 -->

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-broom"></i> Step 8</h2>
                <h3>Brushing the grass</h3>
                <p>The last step of the isntallation is to brush your new installed grass to get the grass pile
                    upright for a more natural look.
                    It can be done with a garden brush for small areas, but I would recommend to use a power
                    brush for bigger projects.
                </p>
